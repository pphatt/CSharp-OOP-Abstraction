# C# OOP Abstraction example

### Abstraction Explained:

- `Abstraction` in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the process of hiding complex implementation details 
and exposing only the necessary functionality. It allows us to focus on `what` an object 
does rather than `how` it does it.

- In C#, abstraction is typically achieved using `abstract classes` and `interfaces`. 
These tools act as blueprints that define methods or properties without specifying their implementations. 
Classes inheriting from these blueprints must provide the actual implementation, enforcing a contract for derived classes.

- **Note: The first article in Vietnamese is really good and worth reading through it**
